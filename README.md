## This repo is for ds-interview-ltv
This repo contains the following files :
  * The solution Jupyter Notebook: my_solution.ipynb
  * The input data to generate the results is the one extracted from the zip file. To run the notebook, you'll need to download and unzip the file, and put it under the same directory of the Jupyter notebook, otherwise you'll need to change the input file path.
  * An environment setup file: requirements.txt
  * ~~A trained model (random forest): my_random_forest.pkl~~ (too large to be uploaded)
  * This README file
